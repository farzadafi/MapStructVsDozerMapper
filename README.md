# MapStructVsDozerMapperVsModelMapper 
This is a simple Project for detect what mapper is faster with another mapper <br />
I checked Three popular mapper <br />
1-Model mapper http://modelmapper.org/ <br />
2-Dozer mapper http://dozer.sourceforge.net/ <br />
3-Map Struct https://mapstruct.org/documentation/installation/ <br />

I passed a List that have 10,000,000 record from User class and Address class to these mapper <br />

And I saw a Very Amazing result!!! <br />
67 second for Model Mapper <br />
61 second for Dozer Mapper <br />
just 1 second for Map Struct <br />
