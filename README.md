# MapStructVsDozerMapperVsModelMapper 
This is a simple Project for detect what mapper is faster with another mapper /n
I checked Three popular mapper
1-Model mapper http://modelmapper.org/
2-Dozer mapper http://dozer.sourceforge.net/
3-Map Struct https://mapstruct.org/documentation/installation/

I passed a List that have 10,000,000 record from User class and Address class to these mapper

And I saw a Very Amazing result!!!
